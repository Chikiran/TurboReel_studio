# TurboReelGPT

**Hey there!** TurboReel is a experimental video engine that uses AI to completely automate the process of creating short videos. Checkout the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdoTjeDDrbM) to see what it can do.

Let me try to explain what makes TurboReel different from other AI video generators. 

Since I was a kid, I've always wanted to become a Youtuber, but editing video is hard, and not to mention you need a good PC. 

This is a limitation for thousands of people. Thanks to LLMs there is a lot of problems that unlocked. Video generation is one of them. In a few years, I belive that video generation will be as easy as writing an article.

TurboReelGPT is my attempt at making that a reality.

## ðŸ“… 26-10-2024: Launched the Alpha version of Mind ðŸ§ , The AI Youtuber.

- [ ] Images and Videos generated by AI
- [ ] Dockerize it
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Add translation feature, to reach a wider audience
- [ ] Trending audios and videos on the internet and use them to generate videos

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Hereâ€™s how to get started with TurboReelGPT:

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tacosyhorchata/turboreelgpt.git
   ```

2. **Head to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd turboreelgpt
   ```

3. **Make Sure Youâ€™ve Got Python**: Grab Python 3.10.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31012/).

4. **Install FFmpeg and ImageMagick**:
   - **For Windows**: Download the binaries from [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php). Just add them to your system's PATH.
   - **For macOS**: Use Homebrew (if you havenâ€™t tried it yet, nowâ€™s the time!):
     ```bash
     brew install ffmpeg imagemagick
     ```
   - **For Linux**: Just use your package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick
     ```

5. **Get the Required Python Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Grab Your API Keys**: Youâ€™ll need keys for OPENAI (for generating scripts) and PEXELS (for fetching images). Get your PEXELS API key [here](https://www.pexels.com/api/key/).

Sometimes Pexels might not have the image you want, so in that case you can use Pixabay as a backup. Get your Pixabay API key [here](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/).

7. **Set Up Your Config**: Create a `.env` file in the root folder. Clone `.env-example` and fill it in with your OPENAI_API_KEY and PEXELS_API_KEY.

8. **Gradio UI for Reddit and Script Engine**: Run:
   ```bash
   python3 GUI.py
   ```
8.1 **Gradio UI for Mind ðŸ§  and Json to Video Engine**: Run:
   ```bash
   python3 MindGUI.py
   ```
Fill in all the inputs and generate your video!

   **Heads Up**: This project uses YT-DLP for downloading YouTube videos, and it requires cookies to work properly. Automating this in a VM might not be the best idea.
